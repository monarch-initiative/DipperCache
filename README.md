# DipperCache

A cache for publicly available files ingested by the
Monarch Initiatives's, Data Ingest Pipeline (Dipper).

Provides a number of benefits
  - A single location we control from which ingests to fetch files
  	- so missing http header timestamps are on us
  	- sources which we can't tell if they are updated save by comparison can be processed
     more carefully and made to only appear updated when they actually are.

  - Monarch only polls the various locations once per interval (day|week)
    - Many ingests may pull from the cache w/o being a load on source.

  - Different ingests may pull a shared  file (they do not now)

  - Files that require renaming to avoid conflicts can be handled here.

  - Files that benefit from preprocessing can be served preprocessed.

Keeping the cache web fetch oriented allows the existing scripts to
function as they are and migrate to using the cache at our lesure.

Development can mix and match source & cache as needed

We may be able to change almost nothing and transparently fetch files from the cache
if they are available.

We can better test when we know the files we are testing __are__ the files that will go
to production.

We can take snapshots of the subset of public files we fetch.

## Implementation

It is a Gnu Makefile.

That it for now, thr dipper repo is also included for the scripts we can keep there.
